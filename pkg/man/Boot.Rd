\title{Bootstrapping for regression models }
\description{
This function provides a simple front-end to the \code{boot} function in the
package also called \code{boot}.  Whereas \code{boot} is very general and therefore
has many arguments, the \code{Boot} function has very few arguments, but should
meet the needs of many users.
}
\usage{
\S3method{Boot}{default}(object, f=coef, labels=names(coef(object)),
                     R=999, method=c("case", "residual"))
                     
\S3method{Boot}{lm}(object, f=coef, labels=names(coef(object)),
                     R=999, method=c("case", "residual"))

\S3method{Boot}{glm}(object, f=coef, labels=names(coef(object)),
                     R=999, method=c("case", "residual"))

}
\arguments{
  \item{object}{ A regression object of class \code{lm} or \code{glm}.  The function may work with other regression objects that support the \code{update}
method and have a \code{subset} argument, but it will fail if the fitting method for the model is iterative and sensitive to starting values.  See details below.}
  \item{f}{A function whose one argument is the name of a regression object that will be applied to the updated regression object to
compute the statistics of interest.  The default is \code{coef}, to return to
regression coefficient estimates.  For example, 
\code{f = function(obj) coef(obj)[1]/coef(obj[2]} will bootstrap the ratio of the first and second coefficient estimates.}
  \item{labels}{Provides labels for the statistics computed by \code{f}.  If
this argument is of the wrong length, then generic labels will be generated.
}
  \item{R}{Number of bootstrap samples.}
  \item{method}{The bootstrap method, either \dQuote{case} for resampling
cases or \dQuote{residuals} for a residual bootstrap.  See the details
below. The residual bootstrap is available only for \code{lm} objects and will return an error for \code{glm} objects.}
}
\details{
Whereas the \code{boot} function is
very general, \code{Boot} is very specific.  It takes the information from a
regression object and the choice of \code{method}, and creates a function that is
passed as the \code{statistic} argument to \code{boot}.  The argument \code{R}
is also passed to \code{boot}.  All other arguments to \code{boot} are
kept at their default values.

The methods available for \code{lm} objects are \dQuote{case} and
\dQuote{residual}.  The case bootstrap resamples from the joint distribution
of the terms in the model and the response.  The residual bootstrap fixes the
fitted values from the original data, and creates bootstraps by adding a
bootstrap sample of the residuals to the fitted values to get a bootstrap
response.  It is an implementation of Algorithm 6.3, page 271, of
Davison and Hinkley (1997).  The residual bootstrap for
generalized linear models has several competing approaches, but none are
without problems.  If you want to do a residual bootstrap for a glm, you
will need to write your own call to \code{boot}.

This function may fail if the model fit to any of the bootstrap samples is of lower rank than the model fit to the original data.  This will occur, for example, if the model includes factors and interactions with a very small number of observations per cell.  In this case bootstrap samples may have zero counts in some cells and lose rank.
}
\value{
An object of type \code{c("Boot", "boot")} is produced.  Any of the generic
functions that work with \code{boot} objects will will work in exactly the
same way with these objects.

See \code{\link[boot]{boot}} for the returned value from this function.
