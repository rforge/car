\title{Boxplots for transformations to symmetry}

\description{\code{symbox} first transforms \code{x} to each of a series
    of selected powers, with each transformation standardized to mean 0 and
    standard deviation 1. The results are then displayed side-by-side in boxplots, permiting
    a visual assessment of which power makes the distribution reasonably symmetric.}

\usage{symbox(x, powers=c(-1, -.5, 0, .5, 1), start=0)}

\arguments{
    \item{x}{a numeric vector.}
    \item{powers}{a vector of selected powers to which \code{x} is to be raised. 
        A power of 0 is taken to mean $log(x)$. Negative
        powers are taken to mean $-x^p$, to preserve the order of the data.
        For meaningful comparison of powers,  1 should be included
        in the vector of powers.}
    \item{start}{a constant to be added to \code{x}; after adding the start, all data
        values must be positive.}
    }

\value{as returned by \code{boxplot}.}
